  <h4>Browsing Recordings</h4>
  <p>
    Trove has been designed to be intuitive.  Browse artists by clicking on
    their name.  Select a date by clicking on an artist, a year, then the date.
    If there is only one recording for a date you will be taken to the recording
    detail page.
  </p>

  <p>
    There may be multiple recordings for a single date.  Every recording for a
    date will be listed together.  The recordings are listed by their Archive
    Identifier.  There may be an orange box below an identifier.  This box
    lists the source summary information from
    <a href="https://etreedb.org">etreedb.org</a>.
  </p>

  <h4>Favorites</h4>
  <p>
    The recording detail page lists information about the artist, date, venue,
    and there is a <a class="btn btn-sm btn-warning">Show Description</a>
    button which will toggle display of the source text file listing recording
    info, set list, and more.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are two icons on the recording detail page.  Clicking the
    <i class="far fa-star text-warning"></i> icon will toggle the recording as
    a favorite for your device.  You can then use the
    <a class="btn btn-sm btn-warning">Fav. Recordings</a> button at the top
    to browse all recordings you have marked as favorite.
  </p>

  <p>
    Clicking the
    <i class="far fa-head-side-headphones text-warning"></i> icon will set
    a marker that you have listened to the recording and when you listened to
    it.  When browsing a date with multiple recordings the icon will be on
    any recording you have already listened to.
  </p>

  <h4>Bookmark</h4>
  <p>
    You can book one and only one recording at a time.  When a bookmark exists
    a <a class="btn btn-sm btn-warning"><i class="fas fa-bookmark"></i></a>
    icon appears next to the help button at the very top.  Clicking this will
    take you back to the bookmarked recording.
